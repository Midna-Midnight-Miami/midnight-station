 # Roleplay Rule 9 - Do not cause disruption disproportionate to your severity

 All roles have a severity, do not act as though you are a higher severity than you are. Your severity level is displayed at round start and in your character menu, and will update if it changes during the round.


 Even if your severity allows for an action, massive destruction that goes against your goals is considered a violation of this rule. Massive destruction: Any amount of destruction that hinders station functions substantially in a way difficult to immediately repair.


 All team antagonists have an implicit goal to keep teammates alive unless otherwise stated.

 All actions allowable to lower severity roles are considered acceptable for higher ones (EG. A major antag can do anything a minor can, a free agent can act as though they are crew-aligned if they wish, etc.)


Antagonists should be a net-negative overall, being a friendly antagonist is disallowed.


 Do not make the Emergency Shuttle uninhabitable or otherwise cause excessive death, damage, or destruction to the Emergency Shuttle.


---

 - Crew-aligned - Without extenuating circumstances, assist the station during emergencies and contribute positively to operations. You may still be difficult, demanding, or unpleasant. Baseline escalation: verbal.


 - Non-antagonist - Without extenuating circumstances, do not actively harm the crew or assist known antagonists. You may pursue personal goals, be obstructive, or create minor conflicts that don't significantly impact station operations. Baseline escalation: verbal.


 - Free agent - Without extenuating circumstances, pursue your own agenda as you see fit. You may be helpful to the crew or harmful, chaotic or orderly. You are not bound by objectives like antagonists but must follow escalation rules. Baseline escalation: non-lethal.


 - Minor antag - Without extenuating circumstances, work towards your objectives using sabotage, theft, and limited violence. You should generally be a net-negative to the crew. You may disable or harm crew members who interfere with your goals, but avoid widespread destruction or killing sprees. You are not a senseless murderer or ruthless saboteur. Baseline escalation: non-lethal.


 - Moderate Antag - Without extenuating circumstances, actively oppose the crew to achieve your objectives using any means necessary. You should generally be a net-negative to the crew. You may kill to complete objectives or ensure self-preservation, and may cause significant station damage in pursuit of your goals. Try to avoid casualties completely unrelated to your objectives. Baseline escalation: lethal.


 - Major antag - You have a one way ticket to the reaper already, are divine in nature, or your mission is worth any cost. You may act as you see fit as long as it does not contradict your goals. You are not bound by "escalation".

 ## Exemptions

 The "die a glorious death"(DAGD) objective allows antagonists to ignore this rule entirely. You can do practically anything you want with DAGD.


 Extenuating circumstances allow for admin discretion in the specifics of what is allowed.


 ## Examples

 Acceptable:

 - Permanently round removing people who you have the objective to kill.

 - Killing anyone you see as a major antag.

 - Permanently round removing a single person so that you can impersonate them to make it easier for you to complete a steal objective.

 - Sabotaging station power 10 minutes into the round to try to get the shuttle called because you've completed all of your other objectives and have one to escape on the shuttle alive.

 - As a free agent, sabotaging a department's power because they tried to make you pay taxes.

 - As a free agent, helping the crew fix power because you decided to be helpful today.

 - As a moderate antag, permanently round removing many people who have demonstrated a persistence and a capability to either kill you or interfere with the completion of your objectives.

 - Causing massive station damage and chaos as an antagonist with the "die a glorious death" objective.


 Prohibited:

 - As a moderate antag with 3 kill objectives, taking steps to permanently round remove many non-objective people who are no longer an immediate threat to you, even if it is done to prevent yourself from being discovered.

 - Setting up an electrified grille in maintenance and using it to kill anyone who walks into it with the hope that one of your objectives will be one of them.

 - Sabotaging power station-wide 10 minutes into the round as a minor antag.

 - As a free agent, crippling multiple departments simultaneously without any reason other than boredom.

 - As a non-antagonist, actively sabotaging station operations or harming crew members.
