  ## 1. Department Licenses
  Authorization to perform specialized duties is automatically conferred to personnel in their assigned roles.

  Lawyer badges are sufficient identification for a legal license, even if proper documentation is not produced, unless it can be proven to be stolen.

  In emergency situations, these licenses may be explicitly issued to others by the following authorized personnel, or the captain.

  Station mimes are considered to have a limited magical license extending to their innate Mime powers as long as they maintain their vow of silence and active membership within La Pantomime Cosmique.

  Station chaplains are considered to have a magical license as per the Centauri Accord with The Organization for Religious Exemptions.

  ## 3. Permits
  Authorization for specific tasks or time-limited privileges can be issued as permits, which function as temporary licenses with defined expiration conditions. Permits may be issued by any personnel authorized to administer the corresponding full license, and must clearly state:

  - The specific task or project authorized
  - Expiration conditions or timeframe
  - Any restrictions on how the task may be handled

  Operating outside the specified parameters of a permit constitutes Practicing Without License (CC, 4.A.10) and potential additional charges depending on the nature of the violation.

  ## 4. Nova Logistics Agreement
  The Quartermaster maintains special regulatory exemption within Cargo and Salvage bays under the Nova Logistics Agreement. This provision permits authorization of all normally restricted items within these designated areas to facilitate efficient operations and accommodate specialty cargo.

  Requisitioning of excessive armaments without proper justification constitutes Capital Negligence (CC, 4.E.1) and falls outside this exemption. The Quartermaster remains accountable for ensuring all authorized contraband serves legitimate operational purposes as determined by Nanotrasen's financial interests.
