  # Core Rule 3 - No Hate Speech or Discriminatory Language
  This is a zero tolerance rule.
  
  Even if you can reclaim a specific slur, this is not the place, and admins are not expected to maintain a registery of everyone and what they can reclaim.

  This rule prohibits all the following:
  - Hate Speech
  - Slurs (including variations of slurs, racial, sexual, disability-related, or language closely tied to real-life slurs)
  - Bigotry
  - Racism
  - Sexism

  ## Examples
  Allowed:
  - Telling someone that you are gay.

  Prohibited:
  - Calling someone gay in a context where gay is used as an insult or negative attribute.
  - Using a slur or variant even in a positive context.
  - Using the word "retard" in any context.
