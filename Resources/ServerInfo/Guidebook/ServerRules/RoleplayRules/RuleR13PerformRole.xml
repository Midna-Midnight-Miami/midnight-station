  # Roleplay Rule 13 - Stick to your role
  Requesting job changes is not prohibited by this rule. This rule is loosened if the station is understaffed or if there is a significant threat to you.

  Don't perform other people's jobs, especially where the relevance to you personally is low. This also covers performing the role of security.

  As Assistants do not have a job, they are exempt from this rule, but may still be charged under space law for various crimes if they try to do certain things without authorization.

  ## Examples
  Acceptable:
  - As an engineer, helping the bartender remodel the bar.
  - As a bartender, remodeling the bar.
  - As an engineer, reinforcing substations.
  - As an engineer, increasing the security of airlocks.
  - As an atmospherics technician, improving atmospheric systems.
  - As a crewmember on a station with no engineering department, you complete engineering tasks.

  Prohibited:
  - As a medical doctor, reinforcing substations.
  - As a bartender, hunting for antagonists or lawbreakers.
  - As an engineer, fighting or preparing to defend someone else from someone who has been trying to kill a random crewmember.
