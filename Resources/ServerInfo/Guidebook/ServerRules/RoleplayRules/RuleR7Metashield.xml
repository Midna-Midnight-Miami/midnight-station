  # Roleplay Rule 7 - Do not metagame, obey the Metashield
  Something that is "shielded" cannot be known by your character during a round until the "revealing condition" happens. This also means that your character cannot do things based on "shielded" information. Knowing or acting on something that is shielded before the revealing condition is met is referred to as metagaming.

  Revealing conditions reveal the shielded information for the round, not for a specific instance. This means that once a revealing condition is met in a round, the shield no longer applies in any case for the remainder of the round.

  ## Never Revealed IC
  Some shields are never revealed IC. This means that your character can never act as if they know about that shielded thing.

  The following are shielded:
  - Current game mode and possible antags during the current game mode.
  - Events you experienced as a different character.
  - All information related to the player of a character rather than the character itself. (See "Metafriending and Metagrudging" below.)
  - All information gained while dead or a ghost.
  - All information gained while in critical condition or unconscious.
  - The fact that a round will end.

  This does not prevent knowing that a shift will end, but does prohibit things like preparing to kill people at central command.

  ## Magic Users
  Heretics, Wizards, Space Devils, and Cultists are collectively known as "Magic Users". While mimes, chaplins, acolytes, and any crew members with psionics also fit this definition, there is no information about them that needs shielded.

  ### Shielded Knowledge
  - Specific abilities/goals of magic user types
  - The magical allegiance of crewmembers
  - Exact purpose of role-specific items (reality fractures, pylons, etc.)
  - Impending sacrifices or sacrificial targets
  - Space devil contracts' supernatural effects

  ### Unshielded Knowledge
  - Magic exists in general
  - Unlicensed magic is a minor criminal offense 
  - Wizard Federation is chaotic
  - General existence of magical items/artifacts
  
  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  
  - the presence or announcement of an Ascension.
  - the presence or announcement of the Veil being torn.
  - the presence or announcement of an Unknown god.
  - the announcement of a "notable increase in Î›-CDM".
  - witnessing a magic user's transformation (glowing eyes, cosmic energy, etc)
  - witnessing the act of someone being sacrificed
  - seeing a space devil contract
  - witnessing someone be dragged to space hell
  - seeing magic summon mobs / familiars (flesh stalker, juggernauts, etc)

  ## Chameleon Items

  Chameleon items are shielded.

  Being suspicious of an item being fake or stolen is not shielded, but testing items or calling them chameleon is covered by this shield.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - seeing someone else cause any chameleon item to change
  - finding holographic nanomachine fibers
  - experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Stealth Items

  The fact that an item can be something other than what its visual appearance and examine description indicate is shielded.

  This shield protects stealth items, including protecting them from being tested.

  The revealing condition for this shield is any of the following:
  - Seeing the item behave differently than the expected behavior for the item
  - Seeing the item used for its hidden purpose
  - Experiencing a situation where absolutely no other explanation is possible
  - Discovering an unlocked uplink

  ## Metafriending and Metagrudging
  This section provides additional information on a concept that is prohibited by multiple metashield items that are never revealed IC. Giving a person or character preferential treatment based on something that your character should not know is considered metafriending. Treating a person or character negatively based on something that your character should not know is considered metagrudging.

  ## Metafriending Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Giving a character additional access or a job because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Trusting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Not fighting a character because you are friends with the player who is playing that character.
  - Ignoring your objective to kill a character because your character and theirs became friends in a previous round.

  ## Metagrudging Examples
  These are all examples of things that are prohibited by at least one metashield item that is never revealed IC.
  - Not giving a character additional access or a job because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Not trusting a character because you are mad at or don't like the player who is playing that character.
  - Starting a fight with a character because of something that they did last round.
  - Starting a fight with a character because they killed you while you were playing a different character.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which that character did outside the current round.
  - Targeting or harassing a character based on anything which the character's player did while not playing the character.

  ## Explicitly Not Shielded
  The following is a list of things that are explicitly not shielded. If something is not on this list, it doesn't mean that it is shielded, but if something is on it then it definitely is not shielded.
  - The fact that the nuke disk must be protected and could be used by a bad actor to try to destroy the station.
  - Items that are of high value or are desired by the Syndicate, and therefore are likely targets of theft.
  - The idea that any Syndicate agent or other bad actor has goals or objectives that they are attempting to accomplish.
  - The number of goals or objectives that a Syndicate agent or other bad actor has.
  - The fact that the Syndicate are enemies of Nanotrasen, and that they regularly attempt to send covert agents to spy on, sabotage, or attack Nanotrasen.
  - A character's typical appearance. Though you should keep in mind that multiple characters can share the same name.
  - The fact that the Syndicate have covert items capable of getting items to them, and that these items are known as uplinks.
